    "You are given a game scenario with classes Goblin and GoblinKing. Please implement the following rules:\n",

    "    A goblin has base 1 attack/1 defense (1/1), a goblin king is 3/3.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Goblins get +1 to Defense for every other Goblin in play (a GoblinKing is a Goblin!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose you have 3 ordinary goblins in play. Each one is a 1/3 (1/1 + 0/2 defense bonus).\n",
    "\n",
    "    A goblin king comes into play. Now every goblin is a 2/4 (1/1 + 0/3 defense bonus from each other + 1/0 from goblin king)\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of all the goblins has to be consistent as goblins are added and removed from the game.\n",
